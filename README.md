# gmatReminder
Gmat reminder app for psychology experiment studying the effect of incentives when combined with deadlines. This project is a collaboration between Deborah Estrin's Small Data Lab and Ido Erev's lab.

### Experiment
There are 4 conditions in a 2x2 design: ***Deadline** (with or without)* and ***Contingent Pay** (with or without)*.

All participants will be told that their goal is to practice at least once a day, answering a quiz of at least 3 questions. They will also be told that answering 3-question quiz in less than 3 minutes is extremely unlikely and therefore they should make sure they make the best they can to answer the 3 questions in a duration not smaller than 3 min.

Participants in the deadline condition will also be told that they should complete this 3-question, 3-min. quiz within 15 minutes from the time the app notifies them to practice (others will not be told anything regarding a deadline).

Participants in the contingent pay condition will also be told that upon completing this daily quiz they would receive a pay of 3 shekels (the others will be told that they would get 90 shekels at the end of the experiment, regardless of activity).

Not everyone receives a reward. If reward is due to participants in the contingent pay condition, then they get it. Others will never be rewarded.
